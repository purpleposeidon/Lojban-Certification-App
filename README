FILE FORMAT
===========
In general, a file is formatted kinda like

  COMMAND: PRIVAL
    Arg1
    Arg2
    ArgN


The rest of this document will list the different commands.
Comments can be put into the file using '//'


SET
---
Defines a variable.
  SET: VARNAME the variable's value

An important variable is TITLE, as it sets the title of the HTML output. In the lines following a variable's definition, it is replaced. In other words, a variable will only be substituted for its' value after it has been defined. Another pre-defined variable is DATE.

Variables aren't handled with any kind of intelligence; they can't be used as escapes or anything.

SECTION
-------
Creates a big section. The PRIVAL following it goes into a big header. You might use it to separate big sections, like Vocab, Mathematics, and Grammar.

  SECTION: Title
    Additional
    Following
    Paragraphs

The following paragraphs are optional

GROUP
-----
Just like SECTION, except it uses <h2> instead of <h1>. Use it for a series of questions that have the same instructions. It's like..

  SECTION: Title
    Directions for the following question

You might also use a SECTION for reading comprehension questions.

QUESTION
--------
The important one, ya? QUESTION can be in two formats: 'fill-in-the-blank' or 'pick-the-bad-value'. There are two kinds of answers to questions, right ones, and wrong ones. The right answer(s) are indicated with '*', and the wrong answers are indicated with '+'.
fill-in-the-blank questions:


    QUESTION: ___ is the approximate value of pi
      * 3.14
      * 3.141592
      + 8
      + yuhm
        Yes, pie is delicious. Mmm, pie...
      + 4/10
      + -3i

  If more than one correct answer is given for a fill-in-the-blank, then only one is included as an option. The order of the answers is randomized. The item on a new line following the question is a remark, shown when that answer is picked.

pick-the-bad-value:

    //Suppose the instructions are, 'pick the most derogatory adjective'
    QUESTION: +bob:bob is a name+ is not a +good+ person, bob is a *bad* person

  Answers are put inside pairs of either +'s or *'s. A remark can be included by putting it after a colon.

A remark is shown when the answer is chosen.
